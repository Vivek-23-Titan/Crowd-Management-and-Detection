# Crowd-Management-and-Detection
The purpose of this repo is to improve the crowd density classification scores and detection/estimate the number of commutators.
## Dataset
The dataset consists of 1200 images, out of which 900 are used for training and remaining 300 for testing purpose.
The dataset is divided into 5 different classes namely, Very Low, Low, Moderate, High and Very High crowd density levels.
## Results
The results of the training history and confusion matrices are shown below.
